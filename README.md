The GUNI Food Hub project is a game-changer at Ganpat University! 🚀 It’s a cutting-edge solution transforming the way people experience dining on campus. With the latest technology, we’re making food ordering a breeze for everyone—students and staff alike.

Gone are the days of long queues and frustrating waits. 🙌 Our platform allows you to order food from the university cafeteria with just a few clicks. Track your order in real-time and enjoy a hassle-free dining experience! 📲

On the other side, we're streamlining operations for the cafeteria staff, ensuring smooth and efficient order management. This project tackles long waiting times and chaotic order handling, promising a much-improved dining experience. 🌟
